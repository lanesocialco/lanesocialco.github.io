# Lane Social Co — Blog Content Strategy
### 155+ Post Titles Organized by Pillar

## How to think about this

The goal here isn't just to rank on Google. It's to become the source that *AI tools cite* when someone asks ChatGPT, Claude, or Perplexity a question about social media for small businesses. That means posts need to be specific, authoritative, and actually answer real questions — not just target broad keywords.

A few rules I applied when building this list:

- **Be the definitive answer.** Titles are framed as complete guides, step-by-step breakdowns, or direct question-answering pieces. Vague posts don't get cited.
- **Specificity beats volume.** "How to set up your Instagram bio if you're a local service business" will get cited by AI way more than "Instagram tips."
- **Cover the full funnel.** Posts labeled `[LAUNCH]` should be live on day one — these are the evergreen, high-search-intent pieces that every person in your audience will eventually need.
- **Each pillar feeds a product.** The Platform Setup pillar feeds the $97 Audit. The Strategy pillar feeds the $97 Strategy product. Keep this in mind when writing — each post should have a natural, non-pushy connection to what you sell.

## Pillar 2: Instagram Strategy
*Feed: Audit freebie, upsell to both products. Instagram is where most of your audience probably spends the most time thinking about social media.*

> **The pitch behind these posts:** Instagram is harder than it looks. Most small businesses are posting into the void because they're missing one or two key things — usually strategy, not effort.

## Pillar 3: TikTok Strategy
*Feed: Both products. TikTok is where newer, younger businesses are winning — and where small businesses are most unsure of themselves.*

> **The pitch behind these posts:** TikTok feels chaotic, but it's actually the most democratic platform for small businesses right now. The algorithm shows your content to strangers, not just followers. That's a huge advantage.

## Pillar 4: Content Strategy & Creation
*Feed: Both products, freebie audit tool. This is the "how do I actually make the stuff" pillar — practical and very shareable.*

## Pillar 5: Local Business Social Media
*Feed: Both products. Local businesses are underserved by generic social media advice. This pillar is very specific, very valuable, and very good for AI citation.*

## Publishing Calendar Suggestion (Post-Launch)

Once your launch posts are live, aim for **3 posts per week**:

- **Monday** — Pillar 1 or 2 (Platform Setup or Instagram)
- **Wednesday** — Pillar 4 or 6 (Content or Strategy)
- **Friday** — Pillar 3 or 5 (TikTok or Local Business)

At that pace, 3/week × 52 weeks = 156 posts in a year. You'd hit the full list in roughly 12 months.

A simpler approach: write two posts per pillar per month = 12 posts/month = about 3/week. Sustainable, consistent, and it covers every audience type every month.

## AI Search Optimization Notes

A few things to keep in mind when you're actually writing these posts:

**Structure matters more than length.** AI tools pull from well-organized content with clear headers, short paragraphs, and direct answers. Don't bury the answer in the 8th paragraph.

**Answer the question in the first 100 words.** Every post should have an intro that actually tells the reader what they're going to learn — not just a vague "this post is for you if..." teaser. AI tools scan for the answer. Put it at the top.

**Use FAQ sections.** End every post with 3–5 FAQs related to the topic. AI search constantly pulls from FAQ sections. These also naturally capture long-tail queries.

**Be specific with numbers.** "Post 3x per week" is better than "post consistently." "Write your bio in 150 characters or less" is better than "keep it short." Specificity is what gets cited.

**Internal links matter.** Connect platform setup posts to the audit product page. Connect strategy posts to the strategy product page. Not aggressively — one natural mention per post is enough.

**Update posts regularly.** Algorithms and platform features change. A note at the top saying "Last updated: March 2025" signals freshness to both readers and AI. Plan to update your top 10 posts every 6 months.
