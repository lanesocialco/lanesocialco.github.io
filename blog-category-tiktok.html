      <h1>TikTok</h1>
      <p>Your account isn't growing because of the algorithm. It's probably one of these five things. Let's find yours.</p>

      <h2>Why Your TikTok Isn't Growing (And It's Not the Algorithm)</h2>

      <p>Your TikTok account is stalling. You've been posting for weeks. Some videos get a few hundred views. Most get nothing. You blame the algorithm. "TikTok's algorithm is broken," you tell yourself. "I'm not lucky enough to go viral."</p>

      <p>The algorithm isn't broken. You're just not using it correctly. Here are the real reasons TikTok accounts stall.</p>

      <h3>The Real Reasons TikTok Accounts Don't Grow</h3>

      <p>There are five main problems. Most accounts have at least one. Some have all five.</p>

      <p><strong>Problem one: No hook.</strong> TikTok gives every video about three seconds of watch time to prove it's worth watching. If you don't hook people in the first second or two, the algorithm stops showing it. A hook isn't a face. It's not a joke. It's a promise. "I'm about to show you something that matters." Then deliver.</p>

      <p><strong>Problem two: No niche.</strong> TikTok's algorithm doesn't push general content. It pushes content to a specific audience interested in a specific topic. If your account is all over the place (one cooking video, one motivational quote, one rant), the algorithm doesn't know who to show it to. Narrow down. Pick your lane. Stay in it for ninety days.</p>

      <p><strong>Problem three: No call to action.</strong> Most TikToks end and hope people will engage. That doesn't work. Tell people what to do. "Comment if you agree." "Share this with someone who needs it." "Follow for more." The algorithm pushes videos with engagement. CTAs create engagement.</p>

      <p><strong>Problem four: Posting at random.</strong> You post when you feel like it. Tuesday, then Thursday, then Saturday. The algorithm likes consistency. Post at the same time every single day. Two videos per day is better than one video once a week.</p>

      <p><strong>Problem five: Low production value (intentional).</strong> This seems counterintuitive. TikTok actually rewards low production quality because it feels authentic. But there's a difference between authentic and unwatchable. Your video needs to be clear, well-lit, and easy to hear. Your phone camera is fine. But point it at something worth watching.</p>

      <h3>Hook Structure for Small Businesses</h3>

      <p>A hook isn't hard. It's specific. Here are five hooks that work for small business content:</p>

      <p><strong>The pattern interrupt:</strong> "Most people don't know this..." or "Everyone gets this wrong..." Something unexpected that makes people stop scrolling.</p>

      <p><strong>The question:</strong> Start with a question your audience is asking. "How do I grow my Instagram?" or "Why won't my TikTok grow?" The question gets them to keep watching for the answer.</p>

      <p><strong>The benefit:</strong> Lead with the outcome. "I saved 10 hours a week with this simple tool." Make the first frame show the benefit.</p>

      <p><strong>The visual change:</strong> The first frame is completely different from the second frame. Before/after. This makes the algorithm think something changed, so people keep watching.</p>

      <p><strong>The curiosity gap:</strong> Show something but don't explain it yet. "You've been doing this wrong the whole time." That makes people watch to find out what they've been doing wrong.</p>

      <p>Pick one. Use it on every video. Test it for a week. If it works, stick with it.</p>

      <h3>Niche Signals and Why They Matter</h3>

      <p>TikTok's algorithm learns your niche by watching what you post about. But it also learns from how people engage with your content.</p>

      <p>If you post a video about fitness and people watch it all the way through, the algorithm says "okay, this creator makes fitness content" and starts showing it to fitness audiences. But if you post a video about cooking and people skip it in two seconds, the algorithm gets confused.</p>

      <p>The fix: post about the same topic every single day for ninety days. Don't branch out. Don't experiment. Don't mix topics. Just pick your lane and stay in it. This is hard because you want creative freedom. But growth comes first. Creativity comes after you have an audience.</p>

      <div class="pullquote">
        TikTok growth is fast when you're focused. Unfocused accounts grow slowly or not at all.
      </div>

      <h3>Duets, Stitches, and Trends</h3>

      <p>These are engagement tools, not growth tools. Use them strategically.</p>

      <p><strong>Duets:</strong> When you duet someone, you're using their audience. The algorithm might show your duet to their followers. This works if you're adding value. If you're just reacting to their video with no point, don't duet.</p>

      <p><strong>Stitches:</strong> Similar to duets. Use a clip from someone else's video and add your commentary. This works best when you're providing a new perspective or answering their question.</p>

      <p><strong>Trends:</strong> TikTok trends are everywhere. Most small business accounts skip them because they don't feel "professional." That's a mistake. Use trends, but make them relevant to your niche. A fitness account can use a trending sound with a fitness tip. A realtor can use a trending sound with a property tip. Adapt the trend to your content, not the other way around.</p>

      <p>The rule: don't chase trends just to chase them. Use trends that are relevant to your niche.</p>

      <h3>Posting Frequency and Timing</h3>

      <p>Post at least once per day. Two times per day is better. Three times per day is ideal if you can sustain it.</p>

      <p>Why? TikTok's algorithm gives new videos a test run. It shows your video to a small portion of your followers first. Based on engagement, it decides whether to push it wider. If you post every day, you get more test runs. More test runs means more chances to go viral.</p>

      <p>Timing matters less than frequency. Pick a time and stick to it. Morning, afternoon, or evening. Pick one and be consistent. The algorithm cares less about when you post and more about how often.</p>

      <h3>What Small Businesses Get Wrong About TikTok</h3>

      <p>You think TikTok is for young people making dances. That's the biggest mistake. TikTok is a search engine now. People use it to learn, find solutions, and discover products. Your target audience is there. They're just not looking for dances. They're looking for solutions to problems.</p>

      <p>You also think you need to be entertaining. You don't. You need to be useful. Educational content crushes on TikTok. A video of you explaining something takes forty seconds. It doesn't need a joke. It just needs to be useful.</p>

      <p>And you're probably too polished. A TikTok doesn't need perfect lighting, a perfect script, or a perfect setup. It needs to be authentic and useful. Film yourself on your phone. Talk to the camera. Share what you know. That's a viral TikTok formula.</p>

      <h3>FAQ</h3>

      <div class="faq-item">
        <h4>How often should I post on TikTok?</h4>
        <p>At least once per day. Two times per day is better. Three times per day is ideal. Each video is a new chance to be shown to new people. More videos means more opportunities. Post daily and your growth will accelerate.</p>
      </div>

      <div class="faq-item">
        <h4>Do TikTok ads work for small businesses?</h4>
        <p>TikTok ads can work, but they're expensive for small businesses. Organic growth is much cheaper. Focus on organic growth first. Get to 10K followers organically, understand what your audience wants, then consider ads to accelerate growth beyond that.</p>
      </div>

      <div class="faq-item">
        <h4>Should I use trending sounds?</h4>
        <p>Yes, but only if they're relevant to your niche. Don't use a trending sound just because it's trending. Use it if it makes sense for your content. A trending sound with relevant content gets more reach than a non-trending sound with the same content.</p>
      </div>

      <div class="faq-item">
        <h4>How long should my TikToks be?</h4>
        <p>Length doesn't matter. Completion rate matters. A fifteen-second video that people watch all the way through is better than a sixty-second video that people skip after ten seconds. Make videos as short as you need to make your point. No longer.</p>
      </div>

      <div class="faq-item">
        <h4>How long before I see growth?</h4>
        <p>If you fix the problems (hook, niche, CTA, posting frequency, production quality), you should see growth within two weeks. Real traction (hundreds of views per video) comes within six to eight weeks of consistent posting.</p>
