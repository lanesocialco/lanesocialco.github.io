# Lane Social Co — Full Product Ecosystem

*Built February 2026 — based on site audit + research library review*

---

## The Big Picture

Everything on the site feeds into two main offers:

**$97 Social Media Audit** — the entry-point service. One-time, no retainer, delivered in 5 business days. This is what we're pushing hardest.

**$200 Audit + Strategy Bundle** — the upgrade. For people who want the audit plus the full strategy playbook. This is the second call-to-action on almost every page.

Everything else — the tools, the freebies, the $7-$50 products — exists to build trust, capture emails, and move people toward one of those two.

---

## Part 1 — The Main Push

### Offer 1: Social Media Audit — $97

Already built at `product-audit.html`. This is the anchor. One product, one price, one decision. Don't complicate it.

**What makes it convert:** It's low-commitment (one-time, not a retainer), specific (they know exactly what they're getting), and priced at an impulse-purchase level for most businesses. The framing should always be "you get a professional assessment of your entire social media presence for less than you'd spend on a single sponsored post."

**Where to link it:** Homepage CTA, every blog post, after every freebie download (the thank-you page), inside the email welcome sequence, and at the bottom of every tools page.

### Offer 2: Audit + Strategy Bundle — $200

Already built at `product-bundle.html`. This is the right upsell because it doubles the value (audit + a complete strategy) without feeling like a huge jump from $97.

**Positioning angle:** "Skip the audit and immediately move to a full plan." Some people don't want just the diagnosis — they want the diagnosis and the prescription together. This is for them.

**The bundle includes:**
- The full $97 Social Media Audit
- A custom social media strategy document (platform selection, content pillars, posting cadence, growth recommendations)
- A 90-day content roadmap

**Where to push it:** On the audit page itself ("Want more than the audit?"), in the email sequence after someone reads a freebie but doesn't buy, and as the offer on higher-intent blog posts.

---

## Part 2 — Digital Products ($7–$50)

These are the things people buy when they're not ready to spend $97 but they're clearly interested. They're also the products that justify an email list — people who buy a $7 product are statistically way more likely to buy a $97 service than people who just downloaded a freebie. Price them deliberately low on purpose.

Build these in priority order. One at a time. Don't try to launch six at once.

---

### Product 1: The Hook Swipe File — $7

**What it is:** A PDF with 100 proven social media hooks organized by format type — curiosity hooks, stat hooks, story hooks, opinion hooks, problem-agitation hooks. Each one has a fill-in-the-blank version so people can plug in their own topic. Every high-performing post on Instagram or TikTok starts with a hook. This answers "but what do I actually say in the first 3 seconds?"

**Why $7:** Impulse buy. No one thinks twice. The goal isn't revenue — it's converting a freebie downloader into a buyer. Buyers buy again.

**What to build from:** The "LEARNING HOOKS AND CONTENT CREATION TIPS" and "AI Hook Research" docs in the project files are loaded with raw material. Also pull from the TikTok Transcripts doc.

**File:** PDF, 8–12 pages. Cover + intro + 5 sections (one per hook type, 20 hooks each) + a page on how to use them.

---

### Product 2: 30 Caption Templates Pack — $17

**What it is:** 30 fill-in-the-blank social media captions organized by caption type: educational, storytelling, engagement-bait, promotional, and testimonial/social proof. Each template has a blank version + a filled example so they can see what it looks like with real content. Designed to work on Instagram and TikTok captions.

**Why this works:** The number one thing small business owners struggle with is actually writing captions consistently. This removes that friction entirely. They open it, pick a template, fill in the blanks, done.

**File:** PDF, 10–14 pages. Could also be a Google Doc template they duplicate.

**Upsell opportunity:** After purchase, the thank-you page says "Now that you have captions, are you using them strategically? Here's the $97 audit."

---

### Product 3: Content Batch Day Workbook — $27

**What it is:** A step-by-step guide + worksheets to plan and record 30 days of content in one sitting. Walks through the pre-batch planning session (what to make, what formats, what topics), the actual batch recording session (environment, setup, pacing), and the post-batch editing/scheduling workflow. Designed for someone who keeps putting off content creation because it feels overwhelming.

**Why this price:** $27 is still an easy yes but feels more substantial than $17. This is a real workbook — multiple worksheets, a planning template, a tracking sheet.

**File:** PDF workbook, 16–24 pages. Heavy on white space and fill-in areas. Could include a companion Google Sheets planning template.

**Source material:** The "Content Batching Notes" and "Content Batching Research" docs in the project files. This product basically already exists in raw form.

---

### Product 4: 30-Day Growth Challenge — $17

**What it is:** 30 daily action items for growing your social media account, one per day. Not generic ("post consistently!") — specific and tactical. Day 1: audit your bio using this formula. Day 5: find 10 accounts in your niche and leave genuine comments. Day 14: try this specific Reel format. Day 22: post a "behind the scenes" using this hook.

**Why it works:** It's low-effort to use (one task per day) and creates a habit loop. People finish it and come back for more. It also surfaces the audit naturally — several days include "run this check on your account" style tasks that make the $97 audit feel like a logical next step.

**File:** PDF, 12–16 pages. Could also be formatted as a printable checklist or a Notion template.

---

### Product 5: Instagram Profile Playbook — $37

**What it is:** A complete guide to Instagram for small businesses. Not the generic "post 3x a week" advice — a real framework covering: how to set up a profile that converts, what types of content to post and when, how to write captions that get saves and shares, how to use Reels vs carousel vs single image strategically, how to grow without running ads, and how to track whether it's actually working. Written for someone who has an account but isn't growing.

**Why $37:** This is the most useful single-platform guide you can buy for under $50. Position it that way. It's the self-serve version of the Instagram section of your $97 audit.

**File:** PDF ebook, 25–40 pages. Or a HTML-based interactive guide. Cover, table of contents, 6 chapters, real examples throughout.

**Source material:** The "Instagram Audit Research," "How to Grow on Instagram in 2025" transcript, and platform sections of the Social Media Management Bible are your raw material here.

---

### Product 6: TikTok for Business (The Non-Dancer's Guide) — $27

**What it is:** TikTok strategy specifically for business owners who don't want to dance, do trending sounds, or go viral for the wrong reasons. What content types actually work for service businesses and local businesses. How to hook viewers in the first 2 seconds. How to convert TikTok views into actual customers (not just followers). How to batch TikTok content efficiently so it doesn't take over your life.

**The angle matters here:** Everyone's TikTok guide sounds the same. This one's explicitly for people who feel weird about TikTok. Lead with that discomfort in the marketing copy — "you don't have to dance" is actually a hook.

**File:** PDF, 18–24 pages.

**Source material:** The "Deep Research Best Strategies by Platform" doc, the TikTok Transcripts, and the "Marketing Funnel Social Media" doc.

---

### Product 7: Local Business Social Media Starter Kit — $47

**What it is:** Everything a local brick-and-mortar business needs to start on social media and actually get traction. Includes: a platform guide (which 1-2 platforms to focus on based on business type), 60 done-for-you caption templates (restaurant, retail, service, health/wellness, entertainment), a profile setup checklist for each platform, a monthly self-audit checklist, and a simple 30-day content calendar template. Packaged as a kit — feels like getting a box of tools, not just one PDF.

**Why this is a separate product:** Local businesses are a distinct customer. They don't relate to "grow your personal brand" content. They want "how do I get people through my door." This product speaks their language.

**Price:** $47 is the right ceiling for this audience. High perceived value (a "kit" with multiple components) but still an easy yes.

**Source material:** The "Map Service Research," local business sections of the Social Media for Small Business guide, and the "Entertainment Niches: Social Media Needs" doc.

---

### Product 8: Social Media Manager Starter Pack — $47

**What it is:** Everything someone needs to start freelancing as a social media manager. Targeting a different buyer than the rest of the catalog — not a business owner trying to grow their own account, but someone who wants to get paid to manage social media for others. Includes: a client intake questionnaire template, an audit template they can run on any client account, a services proposal template, a pricing guide with sample packages, a simple contract template, and a 30-day onboarding checklist for new clients.

**Why this fits:** Your expertise translates directly. This is essentially "I'll teach you to do what I do." And people who buy this are your potential referral source — they learn from your templates, then refer clients who want the real thing to you.

**File:** A zipped folder or Google Drive kit with multiple templates. Or a single detailed PDF with linked templates.

**Source material:** The "Social Media Management Proposal Research," "WorkFlow Research Transcripts," and "Resume Skills & Certifications" doc (which has your own service framework).

---

### Product 9: The NATE Framework Workbook — $37

**What it is:** A guided workbook that walks someone through building their entire social media strategy using the N.A.T.E. Framework (Niche, Audience, Tone, Engagement). Four chapters, one per letter, each with explanation + exercises. By the end they have a documented social media identity — who they're talking to, what they're saying, how they're saying it, and how they're measuring whether it's working.

**Why this is smart:** It's your proprietary framework. Nobody else sells this. It positions you as a thought leader, not just a service provider. And someone who's worked through the NATE workbook but still feels stuck is a perfect candidate for the $97 audit or the $200 bundle.

**File:** PDF workbook, 20–30 pages. Heavy on worksheets and examples.

---

## Bundles (Combination Offers)

Don't build these until you have at least 3–4 individual products live. Bundles only make sense when the individual products have proven they sell.

**The Self-Starter Bundle — $57 (saves $20+)**
Hook Swipe File + Caption Templates Pack + 30-Day Growth Challenge. For the person who wants to DIY their social media on a tight budget.

**The Strategy Bundle — $87 (saves $24+)**
NATE Framework Workbook + Instagram Playbook + Content Batch Day Workbook. For the more serious business owner who wants a complete system.

**The Full Digital Product Library — $127 (saves $80+)**
Everything in the catalog. Positioned as "the complete toolkit." Only offer this once you have 6+ products live.

---

## Part 3 — Free Interactive Tools

This is where things get interesting. Most social media sites have blog posts and PDFs. Almost none of them have genuinely useful free tools embedded on the site. Tools drive organic traffic (people share them, link to them), keep people on the site longer, and create a reason to come back.

Two tiers: no-gate tools that anyone can use (traffic drivers) and email-gated tools that are more complex (lead magnets).

---

### Tier 1: No-Gate Tools (Traffic Drivers)

These live on the site without any email requirement. The goal is to get people to the site, keep them there, and give them a reason to share the link. Each one should have a "like this? get more" CTA pointing toward a freebie or the audit.

---

**Tool 1: Engagement Rate Calculator**

The simplest and most shareable tool on the list. Someone enters their follower count and their average likes + comments per post. It outputs: their engagement rate as a percentage, a label (Excellent / Good / Average / Low), and a comparison to platform benchmarks (Instagram average is ~3-5%, TikTok average is ~5-9%).

Why people share this: because they get a result they want to screenshot and show someone. "My engagement rate is 7.2% — that's above average." Or it shows them they have a real problem ("0.4% — what is happening?") and they immediately want to fix it.

CTA below results: "Not happy with your number? Here's what's hurting your engagement. [→ Free Audit Checklist]" or "Ready for a full breakdown? [$97 Social Media Audit]"

Build: Pure HTML/JS. No backend needed. Formula is simple: (avg likes + avg comments) / followers × 100.

---

**Tool 2: Bio Score Checker**

Short 5-question form about their Instagram or TikTok bio. Questions like: "Does your bio say who you serve?" "Does it include what you do or offer?" "Does it have a clear call to action?" "Does it have a link?" "Does it include keywords your audience would search?" Each yes = points. Output is a 0-100 score with a letter grade and 2-3 specific improvement tips based on what they answered "no" to.

Why it works: it's ego-driven. People want to know their score. And it directly surfaces a specific problem they can fix — which makes the CTA ("want us to fix your full profile? $97 audit") feel natural, not pushy.

Build: HTML/JS form with conditional output logic. No backend.

---

**Tool 3: Platform Match Quiz**

6-question quiz that tells someone which social media platform(s) to focus on based on their business type, audience, and content comfort zone. Questions: What type of business do you run? Who is your primary customer? How comfortable are you on camera? What content format feels most natural? What's your main goal (brand awareness, sales, local foot traffic)? How much time can you realistically commit per week?

Output: a recommendation (e.g. "Focus on Instagram + TikTok") with a 3-4 sentence explanation of why those platforms fit their situation.

CTA: "Now that you know where to be — do you know if you're doing it right? [→ Free Social Media Audit Checklist]"

Build: HTML/JS quiz with branching logic.

---

**Tool 4: Posting Frequency Recommender**

Two dropdowns: business type + primary goal. Output is a recommended posting schedule for each relevant platform. Example: "Local restaurant + build awareness" → "Instagram: 4x/week (2 Reels, 2 carousels), TikTok: 3x/week, Facebook: 2x/week." Simple reference tool. Super shareable between business owners.

Build: HTML/JS with a lookup table.

---

### Tier 2: Email-Gated Tools (Lead Magnets)

These are more complex, more valuable, and require an email to unlock. The email capture is framed as "get your results sent to your inbox" rather than "sign up for our list" — less friction, more conversions.

---

**Tool 5: Social Media Profile Grader (the big one)**

Multi-page form that walks someone through auditing their own social media profiles. Rate yourself on 20+ dimensions across the platforms they're active on: bio quality, profile photo, username, content consistency, engagement rate, caption quality, hashtag strategy, Reels vs static ratio, story usage, CTA clarity, link in bio setup, response time to comments, etc.

At the end, it calculates section scores (Profile: 7/10, Content: 5/10, Engagement: 3/10, Growth: 6/10) and an overall score out of 100. Then it generates a prioritized list of the 5 most impactful improvements they can make, based on where they scored lowest.

Results are shown on screen immediately, then "sent to your inbox" (email capture). The thank-you email includes the results plus a CTA: "We just showed you where to look — want us to do the deep dive for you? The $97 audit goes 10x deeper and comes with personalized recommendations."

This is the most powerful lead magnet on the site because it mirrors the service. People who go through it feel the value of the audit even before they pay for it.

Build: HTML/JS multi-step form. Results calculated client-side. Email capture at the end sends results via your email platform (Flodesk/Kit).

---

**Tool 6: Content Pillar Generator**

Quiz-style tool. 6–8 questions: What's your niche? Who's your ideal customer? What problem do you solve? What's your brand voice/personality? What do you want to be known for? What questions do your customers always ask?

Output: 5 custom content pillars with a name, a description, and 5 content ideas for each pillar. Shown on screen, then emailed to them.

This is the digital version of the Content Pillars Workbook but interactive. Someone who uses this and finds it helpful will naturally want the physical workbook version (paid product).

---

**Tool 7: Hook Generator**

Someone enters their topic or niche and picks a content goal (educate, entertain, inspire, promote). The tool outputs 10 hook options using different proven hook formulas — curiosity, stat-based, story-based, question, opinion/hot take, etc.

People use this constantly. It becomes a bookmark. The CTA at the bottom is the Hook Swipe File ($7) — "like these? There are 100 more in the swipe file."

---

**Tool 8: 30-Day Content Calendar Generator**

Someone enters their niche, their 3 content pillars (or uses the Pillar Generator first), and their preferred posting frequency. The tool generates a month of content prompts — not just topics, but specific formats (Reel, carousel, single image, story) and a suggested hook for each.

This is the most complex tool to build but also the most useful. Requires an email to unlock the full calendar. The free preview shows 7 days.

---

## Part 4 — Free PDF Downloads (Freebies)

These already exist on the site as planned. Prioritize building these in Canva before anything else — they're the fastest way to start capturing emails.

- Content Pillars Workbook — 4–6 pages. Fill-in worksheets. Connects to the Pillar Generator tool.

**Next wave (build after the first four):**

- **The Hook Formula Sheet** — 1 page. The 7 most powerful hook patterns with fill-in templates. Very shareable. Goes viral between small business owners.
- **Story Highlight Covers Pack** — 10–12 branded Instagram highlight cover icons (Canva file, not PDF). Quick to make, high perceived value, high share rate.
- **Platform Comparison One-Pager** — 1 page. Visual chart answering "where should I be?" for 6 business types. Points toward the Platform Match Quiz.
- **Hashtag Strategy Guide** — 2–3 pages. How hashtags work in 2025 (not 2019), what to track, a simple worksheet to build a hashtag stack.

---

## Part 5 — Full Services

Right now there's one service ($97 audit). Here's how to expand it in logical order, without overextending before you have demand.

**Phase 1 (now):** Social Media Audit — $97. Delivered in 5 business days. No calls required. Keep this exactly where it is.

**Phase 2 (after 5–10 audits completed):** Strategy Session — $197–297. A 60–75 minute Zoom. Deep-dive on one specific challenge. For people who've done the audit (or done research) and want personalized implementation help. Loom recording of the call included.

**Phase 3 (after you've systemized the audit):** Done-For-You Content Strategy — $497–797. Not management. Strategy only. You build their content pillars, platform plan, 90-day content roadmap, and profile optimization guide. Delivered as a doc + 30-minute walkthrough call.

**Phase 4 (when you're ready for recurring revenue):** Monthly Strategy Retainer — $500–1,500/month. You advise, they execute. Monthly call, content review, strategy adjustments. Three clients at $500 is $1,500/month. That's the foundation.

**Eventually:** VIP Strategy Day — $1,500–2,500. Full day intensive. Everything together on one Zoom. You audit live, build the strategy together, record it all, they leave with a complete plan.

---

## Part 6 — Priority Order

Don't try to launch everything at once. Here's the order that makes sense.

**Week 1–2 (before going live):**
- Make the 4 freebie PDFs in Canva
- Connect them to your email platform
- Wire up the engagement rate calculator (simplest tool, biggest traffic impact)
- Get the $97 audit payment link working (Gumroad takes 20 minutes)

**Month 1:**
- Bio Score Checker (second tool, builds on the audit checklist freebie)
- Write and publish 3 blog posts (the audit guide, the "why it's not growing" post, the Instagram bio post)
- Launch the Hook Swipe File ($7) — first paid product. Keep it simple. One PDF, one checkout link.

**Month 2:**
- Platform Match Quiz (no-gate tool)
- Caption Templates Pack ($17)
- Profile Grader Tool (email-gated — this is the big lead magnet, takes more time to build)

**Month 3:**
- Content Batch Day Workbook ($27)
- Content Pillar Generator (email-gated tool)
- First real email sequence live (welcome → value → audit pitch)

**Month 4+:**
- Instagram Playbook ($37)
- Hook Generator tool
- TikTok Guide ($27)
- Local Business Kit ($47)
- NATE Framework Workbook ($37)
- Social Media Manager Pack ($47)

The 30-Day Content Calendar Generator and bundle products come later — once you have the individual pieces built and you know which ones actually sell.
