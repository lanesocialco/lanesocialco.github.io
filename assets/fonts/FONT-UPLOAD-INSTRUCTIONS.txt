LANE SOCIAL CO. — FONT UPLOAD GUIDE FOR SHOPIFY
============================================================


BRICOLAGE GROTESQUE (Included in this folder)
-----------------------------------------------
Files:
  BricolageGrotesque-Bold-700.woff2     ← Headlines, nav buttons
  BricolageGrotesque-ExtraBold-800.woff2 ← Hero headline, section headings

NOTE: Bricolage Grotesque is already loading from Google Fonts CDN
in the theme (no Shopify upload strictly required). Upload these files
only if you want self-hosted fonts for performance/privacy reasons.
If you upload them, update the @font-face in lane-social-custom.css.liquid
to point to the Shopify asset URLs.


GARET (Download manually — requires browser)
----------------------------------------------
1. Go to: https://fontshare.com/fonts/garet
2. Click "Download Family"
3. Unzip the downloaded file
4. You'll find files like: Garet-Book.woff2, Garet-Heavy.woff2
   (or .ttf equivalents — Shopify accepts both)

Files you need:
  Garet-Book.woff2   ← Body text, descriptions (400 weight)
  Garet-Heavy.woff2  ← Heavier body text (700 weight)


HOW TO UPLOAD TO SHOPIFY
--------------------------
1. Go to Shopify Admin
2. Navigate to: Content → Files
3. Click "Upload files"
4. Upload all 4 font files (2 Bricolage + 2 Garet)
5. Shopify will generate CDN URLs for each file

The @font-face declarations in assets/lane-social-custom.css.liquid
already reference these exact filenames. Once uploaded, Garet will
render automatically — no code changes needed.


UNTIL GARET IS UPLOADED
-------------------------
The theme falls back to "Plus Jakarta Sans" (also loaded from Google
Fonts). It's clean and similar in feel. No broken layouts, just a
different body font until Garet is in place.
